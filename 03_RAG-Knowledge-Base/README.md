# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This section contains Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that connect AI models to structured document repositories for accurate, source-grounded responses.

## System Focus
- Document ingestion pipelines
- Chunking and embedding strategies
- Vector database integration
- Source citation enforcement
- Governance controls and access restrictions

## Planned Projects
- Policy Assistant (RAG over governance documents)
- Audit Document Query System
- Executive Knowledge Retrieval Bot

## Evidence (To Be Added)
- Architecture diagrams
- Data flow visualizations
- Sample queries and responses with citations
- Governance and risk documentation
- Performance metrics (latency, accuracy, cost per query)

## Business Value
- Reduces hallucination risk
- Improves defensibility through source citations
- Enables controlled enterprise knowledge access
- Supports audit traceability

## Governance Considerations
- Data access controls
- Versioning of knowledge sources
- Logging and monitoring of queries
- Model response verification mechanisms
